abstract = {ABSTRACTThis study broadly explores the impact of risk aversion on tourists' destination decisions and, in particular, explores for differences in individuals' leisure and medical tourism destination decisions. The results of this study indicate that risk aversion significantly distinguishes tourists' destination decisions in both leisure and medical tourism in Indonesia, but not in Singapore. All risk-averse groups are less likely to visit Indonesia than Singapore for leisure and medical purposes. By contrast, all risk-averse groups are likely to visit Singapore for leisure purposes, although they remain unlikely to travel to Singapore for medical tourism. In addition, the study found that the impact of prior experience on the likelihood that the two risk-averse groups will travel to Indonesia and Singapore for leisure was significant. Conversely, the effects of prior experience on medical tourism generally do not significantly differ between the two countries.},

abstract = {This study examines the influences of en route information on travel behaviours, based on cognitive dissonance theory, which explains that selective exposure to new information leads to the presence of dissonance. Fifteen travel activities were identified from the related literature to measure levels of unplanned travel behaviours. Moreover, two types of information sources used during trips were tested to evaluate the degree of dissonance in accordance with new information provided to travellers while on vacation. The results indicated that during trips, those who use information technology change their intended behaviours, while those who use ‘traditional' information sources actualize their intended behaviours. In line with cognitive dissonance theory, information technology is viewed as dissonance-increasing information, while traditional information sources used during trips are considered consonance-increasing information. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Tourists make two fundamental decisions when they travel: where to go (destination) and what to do (experience/activity). Whereas the modeling of destination choice behavior has a substantial research history, there has been little research that has sought to model and explain the choice behavior of tourists when deciding what type of vacation experience they wish to undertake. To address this gap, this study investigates how experience types are related with regard to actual past tourism consumption and preferred future experience choice. In order to investigate these relationships, the authors employed latent class modeling on survey data from a sample of respondents who had reported their recent and intended future vacation travel choices and preferences. Despite the acknowledged importance of variety seeking in a tourism choice context, the study found strong evidence for the stability of preferred experiences. In addition, it found insightful patterns of association between experience types.},

This research investigates four categories of device users via a survey with 383 respondents, in the context of search behaviour and information sources used. The results reveal that search engines and family and friends are the most frequently used information sources while the personal computer (PC) is the most used device for both searching and booking. However, there is a significant difference in how these device users engage with information sources, specifically online travel agents (OTAs) and search engines. Furthermore, device users favour one device and are unlikely to switch devices during the search process.},

abstract = {Purpose ? The purpose of this research paper is to apply the ABC model and examine the attitudinal segmentation of online consumer in India in terms of internet usage, perceived risks, website attributes, intent to do online purchase in future and preference of website attributes. Design/methodology/approach ? A structured questionnaire was administered to 600 online consumers using field and online survey mediums. The logit analysis was applied to arrive at segmentation of online users. Findings ? Findings show how attitudes are different of online users when they were segmented based on internet usage. This segmentation showed attitudes that were paradoxical in nature. To explain this paradoxical behaviour of online buyers, this study applied the logit analysis. The online users were further examined applying the ABC model of attitude. Three distinct segments of online users emerged. They are: CAB, CBA and BCA. Practical implications ? The findings of this paper will be useful for online retailers who want to start e-commerce business in India. The findings are also useful for designing appropriate promotion and marketing strategies to entice online users to become online buyers. Originality/value ? The key contributions of this paper are the new insights from using the ABC model. Based on usage of internet in number of hours, online buyers could be segmented into four groups. On further analysis using ABC model, this studied showed that a better segmentation of online buyers is possible and that is called attitudinal segmentation. The BCA attitudinal segment is a finding of this study and is unique to this research. This has not been done using Indian online buyers and this adds to the originality of the study.},

abstract = {Previous studies examining the intention and level of music piracy among young people have postulated that collective attitudes, optimistic biases toward risk, and beliefs about copyright laws are the key factors involved in their decisions. We extend the analysis by studying the impact of music streaming services. Music streaming is an alternative business model in which, for a small fee, the consumer has access to a large set of songs without downloading them onto their devices. Results from a Logit model show that college students who are frequent users of music streaming are also more likely to download music illegally. A plausible explanation is that those engaged in music streaming are also heavy users of computer technology, software downloading, and digital sharing - factors that facilitate the conditions for music piracy. Demographics, collective attitudes, and beliefs about risk and rewards continue to play a key role in explaining music piracy, but their relevance is slightly reduced once controlled for music streaming usage.},

abstract = {Abstract Ongoing developments in information technology (IT), particularly with respect to the Internet, have led to changes in the way tourism-related information is distributed. These changes have affected the planning and consumption patterns of tourists before and during their trips. Since the majority of tourists retrieve information from multiple information sources on the web, it is essential to define the differences in these sources and identify the distinct characteristics or properties of each source in order to understand the needs and tendencies of tourists. This study classifies online tourism information sources into four types: blogs, public websites, company websites, and social media websites. Five website attributes are identified: accessibility, security, information-trust, interaction, and personalization. This study uses data from 61 participants. Each participant answered all of the questions for four different information sources. This study then conducts an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and a multiple comparison Scheff{\'{e}} test to verify differences between groups. Based on these five attributes, the results of this multiple comparison show that the overall mean values are relatively high in personal blogs, while security is the dominant attribute for public websites. The mean values of all five attributes were relatively lower in SNSes compared to the other sources. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Integrating functions of tourist market segmentation, targeting and positioning can be beneficial to destination marketing. Integration of these functions could be possible by establishing an integrative linkage between destination attributes and tourist needs and wants, and by recognizing the systematic contribution of each function, while considering the interrelationships between them. In today's competitive market, it is true that the integrative process is even more important in order to monitor the market change, to investigate the change in tourist behavior, and to respond rapidly. However, there have been no studies that have empirically dealt with this important research topic. The present study empirically demonstrates the integration process of segmentation, targeting and positioning using the association rule analysis. While integrating destination pull items, this study found that the target markets of Korean inbound tourism could be enthusiasts for culture, shopping, nightlife, interesting activities, and a variety of attractions. The target markets could be positioned using the push motivations such as actively experiencing new things with excitement. Finally, this study intended to identify target market visitors with demographic items. It is suggested that future research may need to pay close attention to the infrequent item-sets, negative relations, and rule evaluation efficiency with various categorization of input item-sets, while considering the consequences of the research design. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Tourists usually travel to cities with good impression . Choosing a travel destination is definitely a complicated decision - making process for tourists . For safety concerns , some tourists intentionally visit somewhere familiar and nearby , but avoid nations or areas with high crime rates or political instability . A wide range of perceptions governs the desirability and appeal of a destination to the potential traveler . The importance of investigating perceptions of travel risks has been recognized with in a number of different disciplines , such as psychology , sociology , criminology and marketing . It is often assumed that perceptions of safety and security may influence individuals ' destination choice . Consumers use information gathered from various sources like word of mouth , different forms of media , guidebooks , talking to friends and relatives , to form a perception of a particular destination . This is a quantitative study conducted in Malaysia . The respondents who participated in this research were the nationals of Malaysia , India , China , Indonesia , Australia , and France , etc .

Three clusters were identified: “lookers,” “moderate bookers,” and “bookers.” A chi-square test shows that significant differences exist between the three clusters based on age, education, income, and the extent to which they change accommodation suggested by a travel agent after having read UGC.

This paper explores how and why potential postgraduate business students looking to study internationally use social media in their educational decision-making process. Due to a lack of existing research, this study adopted an exploratory approach, gathering data through in-depth interviews with 12 postgraduate international students at an Australian university. The findings indicate that besides Facebook and YouTube, students are using blogs in their study search. The two most common reasons for social media usage are finding out about student life and reading reviews from former students. In the decision-making process, social media is mostly used in the information search and evaluation stages. Students' use of social media also varies across source countries. Our findings are a good information source for education marketers who need to engage more actively with social media.},

abstract = {As social media and virtual communities grow in popularity, the spread of word of mouth becomes easier, challenging firms to measure and manage the success of marketing initiatives in online community environments. This paper examines how consumers react to firms' active participation in consumer-to-consumer conversations in an online community setting. The authors develop a tailored community-matched measure of consumer reaction (consumer sentiment) and analyze more than 115,000 consumer posts from 10 online forums with active firm participation. Results indicate that consumers show diminishing returns to active firm engagement which, at very high levels, can undermine consumer sentiment. Further subgroup analyses by conversation type indicate that these relationships hold for conversations that address consumers' functional needs, but do not hold for conversations that address social needs. Finally, results show diminishing returns to firm engagement for consumers primarily interested in product-related support but show no relationship for consumers primarily interested in inspiration and entertainment.

abstract = {Sustaining business success hinges upon a firm's ability to understand and capitalize on consumer behavior trends. Synthesizing information from a variety of sources, this paper discusses the nature of use of the Internet by American travelers. In general, the adoption of the Internet has reached a level of saturation and some traditional channels such as online travel agencies (OTAs) continue to dominate travel planning. While traditional means of Internet use for travel planning appears to be widespread across all customer segments, higher-order Internet uses (i.e., social media) are now prevalent among some segments, particularly among travelers of Generation Y. Also, there seems to be an important bifurcation in the traveler population in that the traditional online consumers remain unchanged with their pattern of use of online tools while sizable groups are adopting emergent information sources and transaction channels. This article details the particulars of these trends and offers managerial implications and future research directions.},

Subsequently, we do the same of social network sites users who are online buyers in the same sector. Finally, we compare both types of clients and discuss their different purchasing behavior. Logistic regression is used to model the dichotomous outcome variables. The dependent variable was to buy or not to buy a tourist service and the independent variables were: the social network sites use, social identity, altruism, telepresence, and Word-of-Mouth. The data set was collected in Chile and Spain from a sample of on-line questionnaires. The main result of this study is the clear difference in consumer behavior between people who buy online tourist services and those who buy these services in travel agents or other traditional channels. The main contribution of this paper deals with the influence of social network sites on offline and online shopping in the hospitality sector.},

The authors seek to provide an understanding of this relationship in a tourism context, specifically in terms of the links between travel motivations and a set of cultural values – materialism, uncertainty avoidance, horizontal and vertical individualism, and horizontal and vertical collectivism. The study examined whether the importance ratings of cultural values differ across segments of tourists grouped on the basis of their travel motives. An Internet survey was used and the sample included 1546 potential tourists visiting the nature-based destination Fjord Norway. Results showed that travel motives and cultural values can serve as discriminators between lifestyle segments. The three motive segments were the nature and novelty, the status, and the relaxation segment. The segments evaluate the destination differently and vary in behavioral intentions.},

This paper contends that, because of general, and sector-specific, limitations to knowledge, systematic and unsystematic risks are central to all forms of tourism activities. There is a need for a stronger theoretical understanding of the different concepts of tourism risks and tourism uncertainties which engages with how these are manifested at different scales, and can be analysed from competing perspectives. The contribution and potential of both rationalist and constructivist approaches are assessed, focussing on individuals, firms, intermediaries, and destinations. The paper concludes by identifying priorities for future research relating to both theoretical positioning, and scale-specific issues ranging from individual decision making to the securitization of national tourism policies},

Using a series of national surveys conducted over the past 6 years (2007–2012), this study describes important changes taking place in the use of the Internet by American travelers. The results point to a number of key trends in travelers' use of the Internet and suggest that there is a growing “bifurcation” between traditional online travelers, that is, those who use the Internet for standard travel products and those who are beginning to adopt alternative channels and products in search of deeper and more authentic experiences.

abstract = {When faced with new technology for tourism purposes, travelers often use information searches in the Internet and, in addition, gain valuable travel information from various sources. This paper examines the travel information searches using social media as a new search behavior from a value perspective. By adopting the value-based adoption model (VAM) based on the prospect theory and mental accounting theory from the perspectives of value maximization of benefits versus sacrifices for a new technology, our findings revealed that the traveler's perception of the value of social media is a primary determinant of the traveler's social media usage. We test our research model using empirical data collected (n = 695) in a survey and run a structural equation modeling. These results are mediated by perceived value. Thus, the users of new social media, especially for travel information searches, are influenced by both benefits (information reliability, enjoyment) and sacrifices (complexity, perceived effort). However, only enjoyment makes an impact directly on social media usage. Thus, this paper discusses both the theoretical and practical implications of VAM in the context of social media on the subject of tourism.},

abstract = {Background: Risk attitudes and personality traits are known predictors of decision making among laypersons, but very little is known of their influence among experts participating in organizational decision making. Methods: Seventy-five European medical assessors were assessed in a field study using the Domain Specific Risk Taking scale and the Big Five Inventory scale. Assessors rated the risks and benefits for a mock "clinical dossier" specific to their area of expertise, and ordinal regression models were used to assess the odds of risk attitude or personality traits in predicting either the benefit or the risk ratings. Results: An increase in the "conscientiousness" score predicted an increase in the perception of the drug's benefit, and male assessors gave higher scores for the drug's benefit ratings than did female assessors. Extraverted assessors saw fewer risks, and assessors with a perceived neutral-averse or averse risk profile saw greater risks. Conclusions: Medical assessors perceive the benefits and risks of medicines via a complex interplay of the medical situation, their personality traits and even their gender. Further research in this area is needed to determine how these potential biases are managed within the regulatory setting.},

abstract = {Background The conditional reimbursement policy for expensive medicines in The Netherlands requires data collection on actual use and cost-effectiveness after the initial decision to reimburse a drug. This introduces new sources of uncertainty (less important in a randomized controlled trial than in daily practice), which may affect priorities for further research. Objectives This article focuses on determining the impact of including these uncertainties at the time a decision is made, and whether more complex models are always needed to address prioritization of additional research. Methods We constructed a typical decision model for chronic progressive diseases with four health states and parameters related to transition and exacerbation probabilities, costs, and utilities. Different scenarios are built on the basis of three additional uncertainties: persistence, compliance, and broadening of indication. Persistence refers to treatment duration. Compliance describes the fraction of treatment benefit obtained because of not taking the medication as prescribed. Broadening of indication reflects a shift in the severity distribution at treatment start. These uncertainties were parameterized in the model and included in the value-of-information analysis. Results The most important parameters were transition probabilities. Broadening of indication had little impact on the overall uncertainty. Compliance and persistence were important when establishing priorities for further research. Major differences with respect to the reference scenario were due to the parameterization of compliance in the decision model. Conclusions The usual practice of modeling only randomized controlled trial data at the time the decision on conditional reimbursement is made can lead to wrong decisions. Additional uncertainties arising from outcomes studies should be anticipated at an early stage and included in the model because this can have a strong impact on the prioritization of further research.},

abstract = {In today's competitive business environment, more and more organizations move or extent their business online. Thus, there is an increasing need for organizations to build concrete online marketing strategies in order to engage with their customers. One basic step towards achieving the objectives related to online marketing is the segmentation of online customers, based on the customer data gathered online. Since there is an onslaught of customer information collected from online sources, new techniques are required for managing and analyzing the huge amount of data, and this is where the concept of Big Data can play an essential role. This research sheds light on three fields: Online Marketing, Customer Segmentation, and Big Data Analytics. The three domains are integrated into the Online Customer Segmentation (OCS) framework, which attempts to show how online marketing objectives can be supported by techniques and tools applicable to extremely large datasets. For the creation of the OCS framework a set of main online marketing objectives is defined. Moreover, the differences among customer attributes gathered from offline and online channels are discussed and OCS categories are identified. Finally, the concept of Big Data is introduced and relevant techniques and tools suitable for analyzing customer segmentation categories and segmenting customers effectively are described. This work demonstrates the OCS framework by applying it on a hypothetical business scenario using an online customer data set.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine young Australian tourists' consumption values, perceived beneficial image and tourist's destination choice intention towards Mauritius as a tourism destination. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through an intercept method of Australian consumers in a downtown shopping complex. A self-administered questionnaire was used; 408 usable questionnaires were collected, and regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Only emotional/epistemic, social and functional values were found to significantly influence perceived beneficial image of the tourism destination. Only social and conditional values were found to significantly influence destination choice intention. Practical implications: Communication initiatives should focus on functional and conditional values such as quality of infrastructure and personal safety benefits. Destination planners and marketers should emphasize emotional values in their programs, as these values bond with potential young Australian tourists. Originality/value: This is the first study where young Australian tourists' perceived beneficial image, consumption values and intentions to visit Mauritius are investigated. It provides policy makers with strategies to better promote Mauritius as a tourism destination. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {In an era when the transport sector is increasingly contributing to environmental damage there is a need to better understand the behavioural response of consumers. Theories such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Norm-Activation Model have had some success in explaining pro-environmental behaviours; this paper examines the application of these to air travel. It utilises insights from previous attitude behaviour research to develop a more detailed understanding of how normative influences, individual values and other psychological factors are affected by individual attitudes to air travel attitudes and how these influence behaviour. This informs recommendations for a policy response, which emphasises the need to bring air travel behaviour in line with other energy saving household behaviours. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study develops and validates a 25-item CE scale that comprises five factors: identification, enthusiasm, attention, absorption, and interaction. The scale, developed from a survey of hotel and airline customers, demonstrated strong psychometric properties across multiple samples and showed CE to exert a positive significant influence on behavioral intention of loyalty for both hotel and airline customers. The scale offers a framework for future empirical research in this increasingly important area, and it provides a useful tool for tourism practitioners to collect insights into customer psychological and behavioral connections with their brands beyond the service consumption experience.},

abstract = {Online chatter or User-Generated Content (UGC) constitutes an excellent emerging source for identifying dimensions of quality at a very high temporal frequency. This study proposes a unified framework for extracting the latent dimensions of consumer satisfaction with quality and ascertaining the valence, labels, validity, importance, dynamics, and heterogeneity of those dimensions using unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Our sample of UGC consists of rich data on product reviews across fifteen firms in five markets, over four years. The results suggest that a few dimensions are enough to capture quality. These dimensions have good face and external validity. Dynamic analysis enables tracking the importance of dimensions over time. It also allows for dynamic mapping of competitive brand positions on those dimensions over time. For vertically differentiated markets such as cell phones and computers, objective dimensions dominate and are similar across markets, heterogeneity is low across dimensions, and stability is high across time. For horizontally differentiated markets, such as shoes and toys, subjective dimensions dominate but vary across markets, heterogeneity is high across dimensions, while stability is low over time.},

abstract = {Although many previous studies have investigated the information search behavior in some specific age groups of tourists, few of them comprehensively examined the relationships between cross-generational tourists and their preferences for various types of trip-planning resources. This study aimed to fill this research gap. The authors employed correspondence analysis to assess and visually display the correlations between four generational groups?the Silent Generation (aged over 65), the Baby Boomers (aged 50?64 years), Generation X (aged 30?49 years), and Y (aged 18?29 years)?and 10 primary travel information sources for the Shanghai international tourist market. The results indicated that tourists in the Baby Boomers and Silent Generation groups rely most on travel agencies and tour operators. The Generation X tourists are inclined to search websites for their travel information. Generation Y tourists are more likely to consult friends and/or relatives and travel guidebooks. The study has both theoretical and practical contributions. The core values of generations are used to explain their preference of information sources from a theoretical perspective. This study assists destination marketers to design effective promotional strategies suited for different generational segments.},

The research can be categorized into seven areas with information search, website analysis, and Internet marketing being the three most common research topics.

Analysis of 455 responses to a structured survey reveals three main travel segments—conservatives, fun seekers, and variety seekers. Conservatives (older, married, and male respondents) have a profound dislike for entertainment-oriented activities; fun seekers (young, single, and female) prefer shopping and leisure activities, and variety seekers (middle aged, single, and female) like all vacation activities.

This explorative paper develops customer segmentation on relevant metrics from the perspective of network operators, handset manufacturers, and application developers. We analyze the results of a smartphone measurement project among 129 users using latent class analysis. The data are subsequently related to demographics and psychographics, to enable lifestyles. We find that several service clusters can be defined from the perspectives of the usage of the network (i.e. voice, SMS and data) and the usage of content services (i.e. URLs and applications). We demonstrate that such clusters can be related to demographic as well as psychographic segments. The results provide fine grained insights in market segments as well as new hypotheses about mobile behavior that are open for further testing. While being exploratory in nature, the study demonstrates the relevance of customer segmentation on smartphone measurement data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In filling the knowledge gap, this study aims at exploring the relationship between the Big Five Factors (BFF) of personality and travel personality. Using self administered questionnaire to Korean domestic tourists, a data set of 360 was obtained that was subjected to one way ANOVA. Out of 60 possible relationships between the BFF and 12 travel personalities, 20 significantly indicated group difference with respect to the BFF. Openness to experience and extraversion factors among the BFF serve in differentiating 6 and 5 travel personalities respectively while conscientiousness and agreeableness explain respectively 4 and 3 differences in travel personalities. Neuroticism among the BFF explained only 2 group differences in travel personalities. Theoretically, the study affirms the application of personality theory in explaining human behavior. The study results shed light on how tourism professionals can use the BFF in marketing and designing their tourism products in enticing and satisfying different tourists having different travel personalities as well as different BFF of personality.},

Market segmentation on the basis of expenditure has tremendous practical potential for tourism destinations, yet the volume of research remains slim. This article examines 20 studies of market segmentation based on expenditure in tourism research in order to identify issues and challenges which currently impede the growth of this area and its translation to policy. Design/methodology/approach - The studies reviewed are analyzed on four dimensions, namely, the tourism market context, the specification of the expenditure variable, data source and sample size and the methodological approach. Findings - To identify commonalities across big spending tourists, tourism markets should be categorized and the expenditure variable clearly specified. Studies using a relatively simple bivariate statistical analysis have more practical usefulness than those using a slightly more complex multivariate approach. Research limitations/implications - While the articles studied have been selected to include seminal and widely cited early studies and to provide a broad overview, no other selection criteria were established. The study is not exhaustive, and further research could be more broadly inclusive. Practical implications - Expenditure segmentation if utilized by tourism planners can help maximize revenue from smaller tourism numbers. The results of this article show the most useful research path for practical application. Originality/value - There is no prior study reviewing the literature using expenditure segmentation in the tourism context.

C) medoids and the membership degrees of each unit to the different clusters.The sec- ond step consists in running a hierarchical clustering algorithm on the (B ?? C) medoids. The best partition of the medoids is obtained investigating properly the dendrogram.Then each unit is assigned to each cluster based on the membership degrees observed in the partitioning step.The effectiveness of the sug- gested procedure has been shown analyzing a suggestive tourism segmentation problem.

However, previous studies have failed to verify this notion. This study is the first to do so, showing that memories of the formative years influence a generational cohort's present-day travel decision making. Focus groups and an online survey of Australian Baby Boomer, Generation X, and Generation Y consumers provided data for the development and testing of the model presented here. Structural equation modeling shows the proposed model is robust, substantiating the importance of formative referents influencing salient referents, value perceptions, and attitude and intention to travel.

Results also highlight that the Internet is used most frequently when people make hotel reservations for both short-haul and short-term leisure travels. From a theoretical perspective, this research provides further insight into the scientific debate on disintermediation for booking hotel rooms, showing that differences based on cultural background do exist and should be investigated via cross-cultural comparison, also considering the relative power in influencing the tourist's choices that User-Generated Content has with respect to information delivered by travel agencies.

Based on Woodside and Dubelaar (2002)'s theory of tourism consumption systems (TCS), five hypotheses were proposed regarding tourists' information source preferences, destination visitation history, future destination preferences, destination evaluation criteria, and travel activity preferences. The study utilized Chi-square and ANOVA tests to detect statistically significant differences among generations. Additionally, two perceptual mapping techniques (correspondence analysis and multidimensional scaling analysis) were employed to graphically discern the relationships between generations and the variables of interest. The results support all five hypotheses, revealing not only a number of significant differences among generations, but also some important similarities. The study provides important empirical support for the theory of TCS, whilst showing the value of generational analysis as a commonsense segmentation criterion in travel market research. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the present study, personality traits (44 items from the Big Five inventory) were investigated in relation to risk perception in transport and transport behavioural adaptations. In a sample of 312 participants, we found that the personality trait 'emotional stability versus neuroticism' was negatively correlated with risk perception (operationalised as "thinking about the possibility") of an accident (-0.38) and an unpleasant incident, such as crime, violence, robbery (-0.25). 'Agreeableness' was also negatively related to risk perception, however first and foremost in relation to perceived risk for unpleasant incidents on transport modes in which one interacts with other people (0.25). Moreover, regression analyses showed that 'emotional stability' was a significant predictor of behavioural adaptations on bus. Regression analyses explained between 17 and 26 percent of variance in behavioural adaptations. The results show that different groups of people vary systematically in their perception of risk in transport. Furthermore, these differences are manifest as a difference in risk-preventive behaviour at a strategic level, i.e. as decisions about avoiding risky situations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

An instrument was developed based on previous tourism and marketing studies as well as focus groups. A two-wave data collection was implemented, with data collected from 1,524 Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou residents in Stage 1 and 311 respondents from the same cohort in Stage 2. Results of the study demonstrated that the extended TPB model with tourist motivation fit the data relatively well, explaining 5{\%} more of the variation in behavioral intention in comparison with a base model without motivation. However, the model with both tourist motivation and actual behavior was not tenable, despite a marginal relationship found between behavioral intention and actual tourist behavior using regression analysis.

abstract = {While in many travel situations there is an almost limitless range of available destinations, travellers will usually only actively consider two to six in their decision set. One of the greatest challenges facing destination marketers is positioning their destination, against the myriad of competing places that offer similar features, into consumer decision sets. Since positioning requires a narrow focus, marketing communications must present a succinct and meaningful proposition, the selection of which is often problematic for destination marketing organisations (DMO), which deal with a diverse and often eclectic range of attributes in addition to self-interested and demanding stakeholders who have interests in different market segments. This paper reports the application of two qualitative techniques used to explore the range of cognitive attributes, consequences and personal values that represent potential positioning opportunities in the context of short break holidays. The Repertory Test is an effective technique for understanding the salient attributes used by a traveller to differentiate destinations, and Laddering Analysis enables the researcher to explore the smaller set of consequences and personal values guiding such decision making. A key finding of the research was that while individuals might vary in their repertoire of salient attributes, there was a commonality of shared consequences and values. This has important implications for DMOs, since a brand positioning theme that is based on a value will subsume multiple and diverse attributes. It is posited that such a theme will appeal to a broader range of travellers, as well as appease a greater number of destination stakeholders, than would an attribute-based theme. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model asserts that both types of personality traits will have an influence on tourist information behaviour. Furthermore it is asserted that tourist information needs will have an influence on other tourist information behaviour, including travel information source preference, information type, temporal aspects, and effort of search. Results from a study adopting such a model will have implications to tourism marketers that use both conventional channels as well as those using the Internet means of communicating with the potential tourists.},

As expected, uncertainty avoidance was positively related to the extent of information search in all three country samples, whereas risk avoidance was not.

This note primarily aims at reporting the use of information sources among various motivation-based segments of travelers to the newly emerging tourist destinations of India's North-East. This is a region with tremendous tourism potential that has not been aggressively marketed so far. Analysis of primary data through a survey of visitors to the region using a factor-cluster segmentation approach resulted in three motive-based segments: Nature-loving Explorers, Nature-loving Vacationers and Change Seekers. These segments were found to exhibit differences in information source usage.

Design/methodology/approach – A comprehensive literature review on travel motivation is conducted to acknowledge the major theories. Two scenarios are presented and discussed by linking two motivation conceptual schemes, Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Plog's allocentrism/psychocentrism model, to practical issues in travel management. Findings – The literature review discloses that travel motivation theories have evolved over time. By linking theories to industry practice, the paper advocates that travel managers be more conscious of travelers' internal psychological needs when designing travel services/products.

Key drivers of global change within the external environment can be classified as Economic, Political, Environmental, Technological, Demographic and Social. Based on a series of workshops comprising a range of Australian tourism stakeholders this paper explores the way in which these key drivers could affect the global tourism industry to the year 2020. An exploration of these trends allows important change agents, on both the supply side and the demand side of tourism, to be highlighted and discussed. In response, innovative strategies can be formulated by destination managers and tourism operators to avoid strategic drift for their organizations and to develop tourism in a sustainable way. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A 4-level AHP model, consisting of 22 attributes on the 4th level, was proposed and tested using data collected from tourists visiting Taiwan to establish the relative importance of pre-selected factors (criteria). By using fuzzy set theory and TOPSIS, the preference of 8 given destinations corresponding to each criterion can be evaluated and given final ranking. Results indicate that visiting friends/relatives and personal safety appear to be the 2 most important factors for inbound tourists to Taiwan, price is the least important and Taipei 101 is the first priority for travelers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Drawing upon Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) a survey was developed and implemented in Shanghai, China to investigate potential Chinese outbound tourists' values in terms of destination attributes, as well as attitudes toward international travel. Five destination attributes were rated as most important by this potential group of tourists and included the natural beauty and icons of a destination, quality infrastructure, autonomy, inspirational motives and social self-enhancement. In terms of predicting intentions to travel, social normative influences and perceived levels of personal control constraints were most influential based on TPB. The use of information sources in seeking information about a destination was also investigated. The evidence obtained suggests that television programs are an important source of information used by Chinese people to learn about target destinations. The role of the Internet as an information source was also shown to be substantial and stands to have a stronger impact over time. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Tourism segmentation research has focused on (1) developing tourist segment profiles using primary and secondary tourist data and (2) understanding which segmentation bases can accurately predict future tourist behaviour. Researchers have not considered how tourism stakeholders are segmenting their tourist markets. This paper presents evidence to suggest that the use of combined segmentation variables to develop tourism profiles is warranted and that a 'one size fits all' approach is not suitable because different tourism stakeholders within a single destination attract different tourists. Furthermore, this research identified that the segments used by the destination marketing organisation failed to holistically describe the tourist groups using the different services provided by tourism stakeholders within a single destination. Destination marketing is complex involving many stakeholders each likely to be attracting different tourist segments and future research endeavours must acknowledge this complexity.

The authors propose a general clusterwise bilinear spatial model that simultaneously estimates market segments, their composition, a brand space, and preference/utility vectors per market segment; that is, the model performs segmentation and positioning simultaneously. After a review of related methodological research in the marketing, psychometrics, and classification literature streams, the authors present the technical details of the proposed two-way clusterwise bilinear spatial model. They develop an efficient alternating least squares procedure that estimates conditional globally optimum estimates of the model parameters within each iteration through analytic closed-form expressions. The authors present various model options. They provide a conceptual and empirical comparison with latent-class multidimensional scaling. They use an illustration of the new bilinear multidimensional scaling methodology with an actual commercial study sponsored by a large U.S. automotive manufacturer to examine buying/consideration intentions for small sport-utility vehicles. The authors conclude by summarizing the contributions of this research, discussing the marketing implications for managers, and providing several directions for further research.},

We obtained evidence of the instrument's good psychometric properties in terms of factorial equivalence to the English original and other BFI translations and the relative independence and internal consistency of the five scales. The findings suggest that the instrument can be used in diverse age groups without substantial changes in factor structure. The Dutch BFI scales showed similar demographic correlates as the English original, with higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and lower Neuroticism values in older participants, higher Neuroticism values in women, and higher Openness and Conscientiousness values in better educated participants. Use of the Dutch BFI will allow researchers to integrate their findings with the extant Big Five research literature. The brevity of the instrument will be appealing to researchers who are concerned about taxing the time and motivation of their participants.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In this thesis, the researcher investigates the implicit and other motivations for Saudi outbound tourism. The Saudi Arabian outbound tourism market is recognised as one of the biggest tourism expenditure. Despite this, research relating to the motivations for Saudi outbound tourism, especially the implicit motives is sparse. It is in response to this that the researcher carried out this study and additionally, examined the influence of Saudi culture, demographic variables and tourists motivations on destination selection. This study employs a model entitled “Integration Model of Explicit and Implicit Motives” of Push and Pull Factors developed by the researcher to examine the explicit and implicit motives of Saudi outbound tourism. Data was collected from 486 Saudi outbound tourists (81{\%} of the total sample) who travelled to three destinations (Bahrain, Egypt and France). Factor analyses were conducted to identify tourism motivation and cultural factors of Saudi society. Pearson correlation was used to find the relationship between push and pull factors of tourism motivation (explicit and implicit) and the relationship between Saudi culture and push and pull factors of tourism motivation (explicit and implicit). A series of ANOVA and T-tests were employed to examine the influence of demographic variables on tourism motivations. Logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression were used to find out the influence of tourism motivations, cultural factors and demographic variables on destination selection. The results of the factor analyses of explicit motives in this study identified seven push factors and four pull factors. The six push factors (intrinsic desire) extracted were: 'escape', 'prestige', 'social and sport', 'experience and excitement', 'enjoying natural resources', 'knowledge' and 'relaxation'. The four pull factors (attributes of destination) identified as underlying dimensions were 'expenditure', 'outdoor activities', 'natural and historical' and 'weather and environment'. In relation to the implicit motives, the factor analysis identified two push factors and three pull factors. The push factors were 'alcohol and sex desires' and 'fun and freedom desires'. On the other hand, the pull factors were 'alcohol and sex attractions', 'drugs attraction' and 'fun and freedom attractions'. The factor analysis of cultural items resulted in seven underlying domains, that include 'uncertainty avoidance', 'individualism', 'differences of groups in society (power distance)', 'social interdependence (collectivism)', 'helping others (collectivism)', 'inequalities and hierarchy (power distance)' and 'family relationship (collectivism)'. The Pearson's correlation analyses found significant correlations between the majority of push and pull dimensions in both explicit and implicit motives in all destinations. Moreover, the Pearson's correlation revealed a significant correlation between tourism motivations (push and pull factors), in both explicit and implicit motives, with cultural factors in all destinations under study (Bahrain, Egypt and France). The results of ANOVA and T-tests indicate significant differences in tourist's motivations according to the differences in demographic variables of tourists (age, income education, gender and martial statues). In other words, the demographic variables have an influence on tourism motivations. The findings of logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression indicate that the tourism motivations, cultural factors and demographic variables have an influence on destination selection. Moreover, the researcher carried out 25 interviewees This was in order to validate the results that were obtained from the quantitative approach regarding to tourism motivation of Saudi outbound tourists (explicit and implicit), cultural factors that describe the Saudi society, and to confirm the usefulness of using the third person technique to investigate sensitive issues. The results obtained from the interviews are similar to the results obtained from the questionnaires (quantitative approach). In relation to the usefulness of using the third person technique in investigating sensitive issues, the result of the interviews revealed that the third person technique has proved as one of the acceptable technique to get information about sensitive issues especially with countries that have values grounded on their religious heritage.},

Results indicate that tourism development preferences are most closely associated with recreation, economic and scenic landscape values whereas residential development preferences are most closely associated with recreation, economic and learning values. Preferences for no development are most closely associated with wilderness, therapeutic and intrinsic landscape values. A simple development index is generated from the spatial data that ranges from positive (acceptable development) to negative (no development) values.

The search action data were subsequently collected and empirically analyzed, and the search styles and sophisticated navigation techniques were identified. The results indicate that the search engine plays an important role in search behavior. In light of our findings, we draw managerial implications relating to tourist information searches in the context of the Web, and offer suggestions for future research.},

Four distinct segments are identified based on the benefits sought, and these are profiled with respect to demographics, travel behavior, expectations about the infrastructure, local environment, services, and costs, as well as the visitors' personalities and interests. Globally, the most important decision drivers are found to be safety, flight and accommodation availability, and affordability. This research also presents an overview of benefits segmentation literature on tourism.

abstract = {This manual is a response to a request from health services researchers wishing to predict and understand behaviour, in particular, researchers throughout the European Union involved in the ReBEQI project (Research-Based Education and Quality Improvement). It is based on a psychological model of behaviour change, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1988), which evolved from the Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein, 1967) and is designed to assist psychologists and non-psychologists involved in health services research to produce an effective questionnaire to measure the TPB constructs. Advice from the TPB literature (e.g. Ajzen, 1988; Conner {\&} Sparks, 1995; Godin {\&} Kok, 1996) has been integrated, resulting in a guide to writing questionnaires that is based on current practice among TPB researchers. Questionnaires based on the TPB can be used to investigate the attitudes and beliefs underlying health-related behaviour. In implementation (or knowledge transfer) research with health care professionals, these questionnaires have been used to investigate the uptake of evidence-based practice. The Theory of Planned Behaviour is the explicit theoretical basis for 222 studies published in the Medline database, and 610 studies published in the PsycINFO database, from 1985 to January 2004. Apparently, hundreds of researchers have used this theory and have gone about the fascinating but time consuming task of reading the source materials and considering current debates about measurement strategies, before constructing a questionnaire to investigate their topic of interest. This manual is a tool that may help researchers to fast-track through this process. For those who have the time to investigate the background issues, we have included a full discussion of our operational decisions in Appendix C. This manual has been subjected to a wide range of reviewing and trialling procedures. We are grateful to many colleagues who reviewed earlier drafts, to workshop participants who used the manual as an instant guide to writing questions and to our bilingual colleagues who provided translations, back-translations and comments on the Dutch and Italian versions of the brief questionnaire.},

This study investigated the hypothesis that tourists seeking familiarity would perceive higher levels of risk associated with international tourism than those seeking novelty. A random sample of US-born young adults was surveyed. Seven risk factors were identified: health, political instability, terrorism, strange food, cultural barriers, a nation's political and religious dogma, and crime. Three-way ANOVAs revealed that women perceived a greater degree of risk regarding health and food. More experienced tourists downplayed the threat of terrorism. However, tourist role was the most significant variable, with familiarity seekers being the most risk adverse. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this context, the logic of the proposition that past behavior is the best predictor of later behavior was also examined. The intervention was found to influence attitudes toward bus use, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control and, consistent with the theory, to affect intentions and behavior in the desired direction. Furthermore, the theory afforded accurate prediction of intention and behavior both before and after the intervention. In contrast, a measure of past behavior improved prediction of travel mode prior to the intervention, but lost its predictive utility for behavior following the intervention. In a test of the proposition that the effect of past on later behavior is due to habit formation, an independent measure of habit failed to mediate the effects of past on later behavior. It is concluded that choice of travel mode is largely a reasoned decision; that this decision can be affected by interventions that produce change in attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control; and that past travel choice contributes to the prediction of later behavior only if circumstances remain relatively stable.

To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test-retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The empirical evidence obtained enables us to affirm that the benefits attained by companies as a result of ISO certification are basically linked to an improvement in internal efficiency. This points to the need for evolution towards more complex systems where total quality management may find its place together with the market orientation philosophy.  Record 2.},

Using an Italian sample of varying age levels, this study examined the relations among personality traits (the Big-Five), demographics (age and gender) and risk-taking. Separate measures of risk-taking in a controlled experimental task were derived for trials in which subjects could achieve a gain and for trials in which subjects could avoid a loss. Personality trait effects differed for gains and for losses, and they differed depending on whether demographics were taken into account. Personality factors predicted risk-taking primarily in the domain of gains where high scores on Openness to Experience were associated with greater risk-taking and high scores on Neuroticism were associated with less risk-taking. However, there was a tendency for Neuroticism to have the opposite effect on risk-taking for losses where high scores were associated with greater risk-taking. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Vacations provide an opportunity to make many choices,and even for travelerswho want their vacations to be spontaneous, planning is often an important part of vacationing. Although descriptive studies of travel planning have sketched out the elements of the vacation plan, these elements have not been drawn together in a conceptual model of the consumer planning process. The theory of case-based planning offers a plausible conceptual structure for travel planning. In an exploratory study of the travel planning process, a panel of independent travelers was contacted via destination information packets mailed to information requesters. Travelers who agreed to participate in the study were surveyed repeatedly during vacation planning and travel. A comparison of pretrip plans and on-site behavior showed that travelers developed plans before their trip, but these plans often were changed, especially with regard to on-site activities. Travelers tended to overplan, actuating fewer elements than they planned, and repeat visitors made more congruent plans than first-time visitors. Results suggest that casebased planning is a useful conceptual framework for organizing and extending travel planning research.},

The typical practice is to estimate choice-based conjoint models at the aggregate level, given insufficient data for individuaMevel estimation of part-worths. We discuss a method for market segmentation with choice-based con- joint models. This method determines the number of market segments, the size of each market segment, and the values of segment-level conjoint part-worths using commonly collected conjoint ehoice data. A major adv{\"{a}}n- tage of the proposed method is that current (incomplete) data collection approaches for choice-based conjoint analysis can still be used for market segmentation without having to collect additional data. We illustrate the proposed method using commercial conjoint choice data gathered in a new concept test for a major consumer packaged goods company. We also compare the proposed method with an a priori segmentation approach based on individual choice frequencies.},

@article{Roehl1992,
abstract = {This article investigates risk perceptions associated with pleasure travel. Psychophy- sical scaling methods and multivariate analysis identified three basic dimensions of perceived risk: physical-equipment risk, vacation risk, and destination risk. Subsequent cluster analysis of the respondents based on the three risk dimensions identified three groups of travelers with substantially different risk perceptions regarding travel. The three risk groups differed in terms of the most recent trip taken and the benefits soughtfrom travel as well as basic demographic characteristics. Interestingly, relationships between risk perceptions and travel behavior appear to be situation-specific, suggesting that it may be difficult to generalize behaviors observed in the purchase of goods to travel decision making.

@article{Ajzen1991,
abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

In a research project, sponsored by the Danish Tourist Council, a sample of 4,000 respondents was interviewed with regard to their vacation and tourist behavior, attitudes and preferences. The data from the section with psycho- graphic variables were factor analyzed. preliminary cluster analysis; of the raw- data matrix (observations x factor scores) indicated that the data structure might be plagued with outliers. Then another cluster analysis was con- ducted (Anderberg;s nearest centroid sorting) with the aim of detecting out- liers. It was suggested that an ; optimal; or ;true; clustering would happen when using 4 clusters. Finally the clusters were interpreted with regard to their socio-demographic behavior and psychographic attitudes, and the results were used in developing marketing strategies in the tourist sector.
